# Neural-Networks
## About
This is just a repository to host some of the tests that I am doing with neural
networks. I hope to incorporate pattern guessing, handwriting recognition, and
more.
## How to Run
To run, first install numpy:
```bash
$ pip install numpy
```
Then run the program:
```bash
$ python run.py
```
## Options
Currently there are two options  `-v` and `-i` for verbose and amount of iterations,
respectively. Verbose prints more useful values and the iterations values is used
to specify how many iterations of training the network will go through. If you
forget `-h` will give descriptions of the options.
